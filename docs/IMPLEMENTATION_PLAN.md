# CryptoPayMap implementation plan

**Status:** Active  
**Last updated:** 2026-06-30

This file tracks repository implementation work. GitHub main, merged pull requests, and CI are authoritative when this file differs from repository reality.

## Rules

- Implementation item IDs are independent of pull request numbers.
- Candidate, canonical, and public-export layers remain separate.
- Each pull request has one primary responsibility and explicit completion checks.
- Live Cloudflare and database verification may be deferred without blocking repository-only work.
- Public product Roadmap and repository implementation status are separate documents.

## Phase 0 — Public specifications and development control

**Status:** Completed

| ID | Item | Pull request |
|---|---|---|
| P0-01 | Development control | #1 |
| P0-02 | Product constitution | #3 |
| P0-03 | Information architecture | #4 |
| P0-04 | Data architecture | #5 |
| P0-05 | Verification, sources, and licenses | #6 |
| P0-06 | Submission and media policies | #7 |
| P0-07 | Technical, UX, security, and privacy architecture | #8 |
| P0-08 | Operations, migration, launch, and public roadmap | #9 |

## Phase 1 — Foundation

**Status:** Repository work completed; live staging verification deferred

| ID | Item | Status | Pull request |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1-01 | Repository and application foundation | Completed | #11 |
| P1-02 | Design tokens and responsive application shell | Completed | #12 |
| P1-03 | Reusable UI primitives and interaction states | Completed | #13 |
| P1-04 | Motion and reduced-motion behavior | Completed | #14 |
| P1-05 | Query, UI, and URL-state boundaries | Completed | #15 |
| P1-06 | Runtime schemas and migration foundation | Completed | #16 |
| P1-07 | CI and test foundation | Completed | #17 |
| P1-08 | Cloudflare staging contract | Completed | #18 |
| P1-09 | PWA manifest and installability baseline | Completed | #19 |
| P1-10 | Accessibility baseline | Completed | #20 |
| P1-11 | Public Roadmap and Changelog loaders | Completed | #21 |
| P1-12 | Integration and quality audit | Repository completed; live verification deferred | #22, #23 |

## Phase 2 — Data core

**Status:** Completed

| ID | Item | Pull request |
|---|---|---|
| P2-01 / P2-02 | Asset and network registries | #24 |
| P2-03 | Payment method and route registries | #25 |
| P2-04 | Entity and location schema | #26 |
| P2-05 | Acceptance claim schema and status rules | #29 |
| P2-06 | Claim asset and network combinations | #30 |
| P2-07 | Evidence schema and source capture | #31 |
| P2-08 | Verification event history | #32 |
| P2-09 | Source candidates, provenance, and duplicate boundaries | #34 |
| P2-10 | Media metadata and legacy identifiers | #35, #37 |
| P2-11 | Public export schemas | #36 |
| P2-12 | Export allowlist and leakage validator | #38 |
| P2-13 | Physical-place candidate importer | #39 |
| P2-14 | Online-service importer and Phase 2 audit | #40 |

Phase 2 keeps imported records private, preserves source and license provenance, produces no automatic Confirmed records, and only allows reviewed eligible data into validated public artifacts.

## Phase 3 — Administration and review

**Status:** In progress

| ID | Item | Status | Depends on | Pull request |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P3-01 | Admin data-access and transaction foundation | Completed | Phase 2 | #41 |
| P3-02 | Protected admin shell and access contract | Completed | P3-01 | #42 |
| P3-03 | Dashboard and operational queue summaries | Completed | P3-01, P3-02 | #43 |
| P3-04 | Candidate queue | Completed | P3-01, P3-02 | #44 |
| P3-05 | Candidate detail and provenance review | Completed | P3-04 | #45 |
| P3-06 | Duplicate review and identity resolution | In progress | P3-05 | #46, #47 |
| P3-07 | Claim editor and canonical promotion | Planned | P3-05, P3-06 | — |
| P3-08 | Evidence review and verification decisions | Planned | P3-07 | — |
| P3-09 | Status transitions and reconfirmation queue | Planned | P3-07, P3-08 | — |
| P3-10 | Media review | Planned | P3-02, P2-10 | — |
| P3-11 | Export controls and release workflow | Planned | P3-07 through P3-10 | — |
| P3-12 | Audit history and Phase 3 integration audit | Planned | P3-01 through P3-11 | — |

### Current delivery

P3-06A in pull request #46 completed duplicate-signal persistence and the atomic decision foundation. P3-06B in pull request #47 adds protected group comparison, explicit reviewer controls, conflict states, route and component tests, accessibility checks, and artifact checks. Duplicate review does not promote or publish records.

### Next delivery

P3-07 will create the reviewed Candidate-to-canonical promotion workspace. It must preserve provenance, require explicit normalized values, and keep verification and publication as later decisions.

## Phase 4 — Public core / MVP-A

**Status:** Planned

Place details, coordinated map and list discovery, filters, URL restoration, mobile sheets, online-service discovery, Home, Stats, Updates, trust pages, and administrator-managed media.

## Phase 5 — Public submissions / MVP-B

**Status:** Planned

Suggestions, payment reports, problem reports, owner claims, photos, private status links, quarantine uploads, review diffs, information requests, holds, partial approval, canonical transactions, and retention jobs.

## Phase 6 — Launch and cutover

**Status:** Planned

Data, license, privacy, mobile, accessibility, performance, security, redirect, sitemap, migration, backup, monitoring, and rollback checks before production cutover.

## Phase 7 — Stabilization

**Status:** Planned

Verify production errors, redirects, indexing, submissions, exports, mobile behavior, and migration completeness before retiring the legacy implementation.
