## Fixed review environment

Review URL:

`https://review.cryptopaymap-staging.pages.dev`

Deployment receipt state must be checked whenever review-environment state matters. A repository merge must not be assumed visible at the fixed URL until the receipt records the intended `main` commit.

Exact later slice IDs are assigned when each bounded scope begins.

## P5-02D active scope

P5-02D establishes:

- exact verified Submission reviewer allowlist and `submission:read` capability;
- protected `GET /admin/api/submissions` Suggest queue;
- protected `GET /admin/api/submissions/:submissionId` Suggest detail;
- bounded queue ordering and cursor pagination;
- strict normalized Suggest projection validation before display;
- P5-02C Candidate overlap and canonical target signal composition inside detail read;
- bounded workflow event summary without actor ID or internal note leakage;
- `/admin/submissions` queue UI;
- `/admin/submissions/detail` reviewer detail UI;
- explicit read-only boundary with no duplicate decision, Candidate creation, target selection, linking, Evidence acceptance, workflow transition, canonical mutation, export, or publication controls;
- focused contract/API tests and runtime checks.

The reviewer response contract excludes contact data, original payload, status secret material, request fingerprints, rate-limit data, challenge tokens, event actor identifiers, and internal notes.

## Route and environment requirements before public intake exposure

A public Suggest route must not be exposed with placeholder providers. It must wire and verify:

- concrete environment-backed contact encryption and email hashing;
- status-secret HMAC key environment binding;
- production distributed rate-limit provider;
- privacy-preserving opaque bucket-key derivation;
- Turnstile secret and site-key environment binding;
- exact hostname and expected-action configuration;
- route-level safe error mapping and Retry-After behavior;
- no logging of challenge token, raw remote IP, plaintext email, plaintext status secret, or provider secret;
- configured-environment verification of the complete route path.

## Retained Launch work

Starting or completing Phase 5 does not waive retained Launch work, including:

- live Cloudflare Access and identity verification;
- actual allowlist and deployed environment verification;
- live Neon migration-state verification;
- representative protected Admin journeys with configured data;
- canonical query → complete candidate generation → private upload → release-review handoff;
- corrected canonical value → generation → release → activation flow;
- concrete R2 publication conditional-write verification;
- production restore persistence, invocation, R2 adapter wiring, durable restore Audit source, reconciliation runbook, and drills.

Launch readiness must not be claimed until the relevant launch criteria and retained Launch work are complete.

## Next

Complete P5-02D and merge it green. Then begin the next bounded P5-02 slice for the first guarded Suggest review action boundary.

## Blocked

No known repository blocker to P5-02D.

Production contact encryption, HMAC key environment binding, production distributed rate limiting, opaque bucket-key derivation, and Turnstile environment binding remain required before a public Suggest route is exposed.

Production restore completion remains a Launch gate rather than a P5-02 repository start blocker.

## Verification rule

Repository reality is determined by current `main`, merged pull requests, and actual CI results. Current work order is determined by `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and the active phase specification.

Do not claim live verification from repository checks alone. Do not claim visual acceptance from screenshot generation alone; relevant images must be inspected directly.
