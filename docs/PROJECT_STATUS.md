## Fixed review environment

Review URL:

`https://review.cryptopaymap-staging.pages.dev`

Deployment receipt state must be checked whenever review-environment state matters. A repository merge must not be assumed visible at the fixed URL until the receipt records the intended `main` commit.

Exact later slice IDs are assigned when each bounded scope begins.

## P5-02H active scope

P5-02H establishes:

- one explicit `in_review → resolved / accepted_as_candidate` outcome;
- separate exact verified Candidate-create allowlist and `submission:candidate:create` capability;
- configured `CPM_USER_SUBMISSION_SOURCE_ID` source channel;
- atomic verification that the configured source exists, is active, and uses `user_submission` type;
- strict normalized Suggest projection revalidation immediately before transaction planning;
- deterministic Candidate and Source Record IDs from the request UUID;
- stable SHA-256 content hash for normalized source material;
- exact Submission status/update-time guard;
- normalized payload update-time guard;
- one atomic Source Record + Candidate + origin link + Submission resolution + durable event transaction;
- private Candidate status `new` with no canonical target or duplicate group preassignment;
- durable replay and changed-semantics UUID conflict behavior;
- concurrent identical transaction replay recovery;
- protected `POST /admin/api/submissions/:submissionId/accept-candidate` endpoint;
- reviewer detail accepted-as-Candidate panel available only from `in_review`;
- focused service/API tests, runtime checks, and staging artifact validation.

P5-02H does not add duplicate/no-change outcomes, Candidate duplicate-group decisions, Candidate promotion, canonical target selection, existing-target linking, Evidence acceptance, canonical application, export, or publication.

## Route and environment requirements before public intake exposure

A public Suggest route must not be exposed with placeholder providers. It must wire and verify:

- concrete environment-backed contact encryption and email hashing;
- status-secret HMAC key environment binding;
- production distributed rate-limit provider;
- privacy-preserving opaque bucket-key derivation;
- Turnstile secret and site-key environment binding;
- exact hostname and expected-action configuration;
- route-level safe error mapping and Retry-After behavior;
- no logging of challenge token, raw remote IP, plaintext email, plaintext status secret, or provider secret;
- configured-environment verification of the complete route path.

## Retained Launch work

Starting or completing Phase 5 does not waive retained Launch work, including:

- live Cloudflare Access and identity verification;
- actual allowlist and deployed environment verification;
- live Neon migration-state verification;
- representative protected Admin journeys with configured data;
- canonical query → complete candidate generation → private upload → release-review handoff;
- corrected canonical value → generation → release → activation flow;
- concrete R2 publication conditional-write verification;
- production restore persistence, invocation, R2 adapter wiring, durable restore Audit source, reconciliation runbook, and drills.

Launch readiness must not be claimed until the relevant launch criteria and retained Launch work are complete.

## Next

Complete P5-02H and merge it green. Then wire the public Suggest route/form with real environment-backed providers and close P5-02 with an integration and handoff audit.

## Blocked

No known repository blocker to P5-02H.

`CPM_USER_SUBMISSION_SOURCE_ID` and the Candidate-create allowlist are required in configured environments before the new transaction can run there.

Production contact encryption, HMAC key environment binding, production distributed rate limiting, opaque bucket-key derivation, and Turnstile environment binding remain required before a public Suggest route is exposed.

Production restore completion remains a Launch gate rather than a P5-02 repository start blocker.

## Verification rule

Repository reality is determined by current `main`, merged pull requests, and actual CI results. Current work order is determined by `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and the active phase specification.

Do not claim live verification from repository checks alone. Do not claim visual acceptance from screenshot generation alone; relevant images must be inspected directly.
