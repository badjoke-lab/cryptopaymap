## Current phase

Phase 6 — Launch and cutover evidence

## Current execution item

OPS-P6-001 — Configured launch authorization, bounded go-live execution, external verification, observation, and launch close (Issue #293)

## Current operational slice

OPS-P6-001C — Implement configured staging authorization gate (Issue #298, PR #299)

## Authoritative current state

- P6-08 repository definition work completed in PR #291 for Issue #290.
- FIX-P6-001 tracking reconciliation completed in PR #294 for Issue #292.
- OPS-P6-001A readiness diagnostics completed in PR #296.
- Latest verified main is `71962246127a06b9de708595518666b4b93c4e4a`.
- A fresh fixed-review Neon database was initialized through guarded workflow run `30465445438`; schema and migration-ledger verification passed.
- The configured staging deployment receipt records `status: deployed`, configured readiness success, and successful Cloudflare credential, input, Durable Object, Pages secret, deployment, and verification checks.
- The fixed-review live-audit receipt records `status: complete`, first POST HTTP 202, exact replay HTTP 202 with matching public reference and status secret, changed-content HTTP 409, and unchanged public artifacts.
- OPS-P6-001B in Issue #297 is completed.
- OPS-P6-001C in Issue #298 and PR #299 adds the fail-closed configured staging authorization inventory and dispatch gate.

Configured state remains:

```text
Configured staging authorization: not authorized
Configured production authorization: not authorized
Go-live execution: not executed
Post-cutover verification: not proven
Launch-close evidence: not proven
```

Repository CI, documentation, provider control-plane success, or an operator assertion alone cannot change those configured states.

## Next

Execute OPS-P6-001C in Issue #298 and PR #299:

1. pass normal repository validation and the dedicated authorization self-test;
2. merge the gate to `main`;
3. retain the automatic `inventory` receipt on the `staging-review` branch;
4. confirm the exact missing or stale P6-01 through P6-07 configured predecessor list;
5. execute each missing configured predecessor separately without fabricating evidence from repository CI;
6. run the explicit authorization dispatch only after every predecessor is current and bound to the same commit, release, data snapshot, configuration, and environment;
7. keep production authorization, DNS cutover, go-live, and Phase 7 blocked until staging authorization is real and current.

## Blocked

No Neon, migration, configured staging deployment, readiness, or fixed-review live-journey blocker remains.

Configured staging authorization is blocked until real configured P6-01 through P6-07 predecessor receipts are current, non-expired, exact-commit bound, and mutually identity-consistent. PR #299 is the gate that names those blockers and prevents inventory or repository CI from being treated as authorization.

Protected operational credentials and private evidence must not be placed in the public repository or public Issue content.

## Retained executable-audit snapshot

The following snapshot preserves exact historical markers used by retained P5-08 and P6-01 through P6-08 executable audits. It is not the authoritative current state; the current state is above.

## Latest verified main

0b0b328b8cb002977f1aa34e7385fc8eef56d324

The P6-07 head passed Foundation validation, Migration drift, retained P5-08A through P5-08F audits, P6-01 through P6-06, and the dedicated P6-07 audit before merge.

## Active pull request

Pending — P6-08 final launch authorization, go-live execution, post-cutover verification, and launch-close evidence

## Current boundary

P6-08 defines the final fail-closed authorization and execution contract, exact release/data/configuration binding, no-go and revocation rules, bounded go-live ownership, external post-cutover verification, rollback proof, observation-window requirements, and immutable launch-close evidence.

Repository validation can prove that this contract is complete and internally consistent. It cannot authorize launch or mark configured staging or production go-live as executed without real approvals, executions, external observations, and retained redacted artifacts.

## Next

Pass normal repository workflows and the dedicated P6-08 audit, merge P6-08, then begin post-launch operational verification, recurring evidence freshness, incident follow-up, and production change governance.

## Blocked

No repository blocker is known.

Configured staging and production launch authorization remain `not authorized`. Go-live remains blocked until every mandatory configured predecessor receipt is current, a bounded authorization is issued, execution occurs, external post-cutover verification passes, the observation window completes, and launch-close evidence is retained.
```

## Verification rule

Repository reality is determined by current `main`, merged pull requests, actual CI results, and fixed-review receipts. Configured launch reality is determined by current protected-environment receipts and external observations. If this file differs from either authoritative source, correct it in the next bounded pull request.
